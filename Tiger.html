         <p>
         The tiger is the largest of the big cats reaching four metres in length and weighing in at around 300 kilograms. Tigers have an unmistakable and unique black striped pattern over orange fur which helps them to stay camouflaged as they lay in wait for their prey. No two tigers will have the same stripes, similar to the fingerprints of a human. Generally they are solitary except during mating season and when the female has cubs with her.Renowned for their strength and power, they hunt alone taking medium to larger prey, travelling long distances to catch buffalo and wild pigs, as well as other large mammals. They are one of the few cats that are very comfortable in water often swimming or lounging in the shallows to cool off.

         <p class="ParagraphStyleOne">
        Tiger cubs become independent around 18 months of age, but it is not until they are around 2–2.5 years old that they leave their mother. Tiger cubs, like all young animals, enjoy play-fighting. Just like the domestic housecat, tigers keep their claws sharp for hunting by pulling in their retractable claws into a protective sheath.All cats, including tigers, have a distinct scent associated with them due to their individualized scent glands. The individualized scent helps cubs track their mother's path and serves to identify particular individuals. Cats have scent glands between their toes, tail, anus, head, chin, lips, cheeks, and facial whiskers.
