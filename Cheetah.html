         <p>
         Sometimes confused with leopards, cheetahs actually have very different markings; from their solid spots, opposed to the rosettes of a leopard, to the black ‘tear’ marks running down their cheeks. They have more slender bodies and longer legs and, unlike all other big cats, cannot retract their claws. Cheetahs hunt during the day to avoid competition with the larger cats, including lion and leopard. Their ‘tear’ marks help to absorb the bright sunlight and prevent glare and they will hunt anything, from baby antelope and ostrich to wildebeest.Rather than hide in the foliage, cheetahs are usually found in open spaces – this allows them to chase down their prey without obstacles. Usually solitary animals, you may find a family group sticking together or a group of dominant males forming a coalition. The young cubs are born to resemble honey badgers as a form of defence. Found in fragmented parks from South Africa through to Kenya and Tanzania with an extremely small population (50) found in Iran.

         <h2> Cheetah Facts </h2>
         <p class="ParagraphStyleOne">
          Cheetah are the fastest mammals on land being able to reach speeds of 120km/h over short distances. They will often use these short bursts of speed when stalking their prey to make a kill.
          </p> 
          <p class="ParagraphStyleOne">
          When running, cheetahs use their tail to steer, like a rudder for a boat
         </p> 
           <p> 
          <p class="ParagraphStyleOne">
           Cheetahs can cover more than 7m in one stride and more than 25m in a second
         </p>
            <p>
            Cheetah cubs can be easily confused by other predators as a honey badger – a small feisty carnivore that most predators leave alone

          A baby cheetah is called a cub.Female cheetahs live alone unless she is caring for her cubs.A mother cheetah usually has 3 to 5 cubs but up to 9 cubs can be born. A mother will stay with her cubs for 18 months then she will leave them.The cubs will stay together for another 6 months. After 6 months the females will leave on their own and the males will stay together for life.heetahs are carnivores meaning they eat meat. They have brilliant eyesight. They can see up to 3 miles (nearly 5km) away! Wow, that really is far! Cheetahs hunt in the day time. They use their excellent eyesight to look for prey then sprint to pounce on them.
