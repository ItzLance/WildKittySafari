         <p>
        The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet) long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170–230 kg (370–500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9–1.1 metres, and a weight of 120–180 kg. The lion’s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.

         <p class="ParagraphStyleOne">
          Lions are very social compared to other cat species, often living in prides that feature females, offspring and a few adult males.
          </p> 
          <p class="ParagraphStyleOne">
          Lions can reach speeds of up to 81 kph (50 mph) but only in short bursts because of a lack of stamina.
         </p> 
           <p> 
          <p class="ParagraphStyleOne">
           Lionesses are better hunters than males and do most of the hunting for a pride.
         </p>
            <p class="ParagraphStyleOne">
            Male lions are easy to recognize thanks to their distinctive manes. Males with darker manes are more likely to attract female lions (lionesses).

        The Mom lion gives birth away from the pride to keep the lion babies safe. She’s pregnant for about 110 days and can have 3-6 lion baby cubs! Like baby kittens and puppies, lion cubs are born blind and don’t open their eyes until about a week after birth. They start walking and crawling within just 2-4 days of being born! That’s super quick for a baby. Mom moves the lion babies around to ensure they stay safe and predators aren’t around. They get to meet the rest of the pride around six to eight weeks after they’re born. Just like when you meet new people, the lion cubs can be scared at first. They’re still babies and love to play! The cubs will get comfortable quickly and ask the adults to play with them.
